# IND Appointment Check

## Are you tired of having an appointment scheduled in 2 months?

This script allows you to query the IND API and find the earliest appointment possible.
It will check every 5 seconds, which will usually guarantee you an appointment the very next day if someone cancels.

(Keep in mind this only checks for available appointments, you have to book it yourself)
